## Project Explanation

- `main.py`: This file contains the main application logic and user interface setup.
- `core/pyc.py`: This module manages camera operations and filter application.
- `interface/gui.py`: This module manages camera interface with operations and filter application.
- `models/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`:  The `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file is a cascade XML file used for face detection. It is part of the OpenCV library and is widely used in face detection tasks. The file contains information about facial features and appearance patterns that are used by the face detection algorithm.

For more information about the file and its usage, see the [official OpenCV documentation](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml).
